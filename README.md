# Tennis score

This code challenge is about implementing a simple tennis score. Each set is one game.
We highly encourage you to write tests to implement this solution.

## Mechanism

The scoring system is rather simple:

- Each player can have either of these points in one game: 0 15 30 40
- If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game, however there are special rules:
  - If both have 40 the players are deuce.
  - If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball.
  - If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
  - If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
